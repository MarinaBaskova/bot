## Simple chatbot with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The goal for this project was to build chatbot that helps find study resources for students.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Functionality

 User can choose from provided options in the chat to get to the suggested resource link. Users can select the level of expertise, learning style (video, article), and what course they are taking.

## Tech

React was used for building reusable UI components with a faster render of the virtual DOM.

React emoji was used for building emoji picker in the user input.

TODO: The next steps will be to bring interaction between the User and bot from the User's input messages.
